# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this project, I had to audit election results from 3 counties for 3 congress candidates. 

Based on the outcome of the votes, Diana DeGette won the election by receieving the most amount of votes and the highest percentage of votes calculated by the total amount of votes casted. I calculated the the total number of votes, got an overall list of candidates who received votes (each individual vote had a unique ballot ID number), I then calculated the total amount of votes each candidate received. From that, I was able to calculate the percentage the candidate won which would show who the winner was for the election.

## Resources
The resources I used to extract the data from was: election_results.csv
The software I used was Python 3.7 and Visual Studio Code 1.49.2

## Summary
The total amount of votes casted were 369,711. 

The three candidates received the following votes:
- Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 (23.0% of the votes)
- Diana DeGette received 272,892 (73.8% of the votes)
- Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 (3.1% of the votes)

Based on the data found, Diana DeGette was the winner of the election by obtaining 272,892 votes, which was 73.8% as the highest percentage from the total votes.

## Challenge Overview
For the challenge, I then determined which counties had the biggest turnout based on the voter count from each county. After that, I calculated the percentage of votes that were casted by each county. I was able to determine which county had the highest turnout of voters based on the count and percentage found in my analysis.

## Challenge Resources
The resources I used to extract the data from was: election_results.csv
The software I used was Python 3.7 and Visual Studio Code 1.49.2

## Challenge Summary

The total count of votes per each county was:
- Jefferson county resident votes were 38,855 (10.5% of total votes)
- Denver county resident votes were 306,055 (82.8% of total votes)
- Arapahoe county resident votes were 24,801 (6.7% of total votes)

You can deduce that the county that had the largest turnout of votes was Denver county with 306,055 votes which made up 82.8% of the total votes.
